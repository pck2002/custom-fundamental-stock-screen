Custom Fundamental Stock Screener - Cash Taxes Paid to Market Cap

R Code (aqfsCodeYear) and sample csv output (TaxesMarketCap)

wanted to sort stocks by P/T ratio (Price to Taxes Paid Ratio) - a cousin to the P/E ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio)
wonder if this ratio is widely used? Perhaps the fact that I need to writed this for a simple screen may tell me something
anyways couldn't find any free screens to do this so I decided to make a rough go of one myself it still needs work but here a start:

data and code sources (perhaps the most useful lines of this project):

SEC AQFS data from http://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html
cik to ticker from http://rankandfiled.com/#/data/tickers
script to get market caps (thanks yahoo) from http://allthingsr.blogspot.com/2012/10/pull-yahoo-finance-key-statistics.html
